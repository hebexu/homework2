# homework2
to create personal responsive portfolio

Introduction:
This responsive portfolio introduces my personal information which shows my education background, my professions as well as my favourite hobby.

Step by step to create repository and publish github page:
I created the repository in my github:https://github.com/hebexu/homework2 and used html language and bootstrap to create the index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html file in visual studio, which apply to different mobility devices. Finally, I published my GitHub Page at: https://hebexu.github.io/homework2/.

Learning Summary:
I have being quite confident for using github and bootstrap now after completing this homework;
I have learned how to use https://validator.w3.org/ to check if my html is valid.
Using bootstrap grid is still not my strength, I need to keep practicing.
